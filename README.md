# Color-based Image Segmentation Project

## Project Idea

The goal of this project is to implement and compare two color-based image segmentation techniques on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Specifically, we will develop:

1. **K-means Clustering for K-class Image Segmentation**:
   - Implement a custom version of the K-means clustering algorithm.
   - Segment images into K=4 color-based classes.

2. **Spectral Clustering for K-class Image Segmentation**:
   - Develop a custom version of the Spectral clustering algorithm (also known as the Normalized-cut algorithm).
   - Perform segmentation into K=4 color-based classes using this method.

## Testing

The algorithms will be tested on images of horses, deer, and airplanes from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The segmentation results obtained with both K-means and Spectral clustering will be compared to evaluate their performance.

## Useful Materials
